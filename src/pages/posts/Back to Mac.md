# Back to Mac
Back when I was in college, I ended up using a base level Macbook Pro. Why? Because it's what the head of the Computer Science college suggested for incoming freshman. That was it.

Though, that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. I enjoyed my time with that Macbook, even with its unremarkable performance (mind you, this was back in the Intel days). Once I got out of college, I switched to just using a desktop and a cheap little Windows laptop for whenever I needed to remote access my work computer. But, the time was coming for a new laptop as I had more aspirations of remote work. This led me to look at the various options that were out there, but one laptop in particular caught my eye: a M4 Macbook Air. It looked nothing like the Macbook Air's from my college days: this one was sleek, performant, and an even more ridiculous battery life. And a $1000 price tag (which I suspect will balloon given the new RAM shortage) **and a $200 off sale?!**

Safe to say, I am now typing this up on a Macbook Air.

And so far, I am quite pleased with it. And so, I wanted to take a minute to write up the little features, annoyances, and joys from my time with this new toy.

## MacOS
One thing that is really nice about MacOS is the UNIX foundation, which feels more comfortable to me. Being able to immediately open up a terminal and see that zsh prompt just felt immediately soothing. Within seconds I got homebrew installed, and from there everything my heart desired for my programming needs was installed. It was lovely

That being said, I wouldn't call MacOS my favorite operating system. Why can't I use Finder to navigate through the filesystem without requiring hopping from predefined "key" directories? Why do I have to fine-toggle so many permissions on for each app and for each permission? Why does the default screen capture software suck?

But, honestly, it's about as annoying to me as Windows is. And there's plenty of ways around each annoyance. Well, most of them. 

## The Ability to Screen Mirror to my Living Room TV
The main reason I want a laptop is to work away from my desktop, but what I forgot about is that Mac's have the ability to screen mirror to other supported devices, like an iPad. While my iPad mini is a *bit* too small for that, my TV is perfect. I would see this being great for someone in a home with multiple TVs and potentially needing to go from room to room, you can make yourself a little office utilizing what's already there with just your laptop.

## Battery
Man, this battery life rules. With my workload, I am easily getting over 12 hours on a charge. I can leave the house and just not think about needing to top up for the day. How can you beat that?! Beyond that, the performance of the laptop seems total fine to me. I'm not exactly a power user, which is why I didn't even bother looking at anything over a Macbook Air, but the laptop is plenty snappy and I have yet to notice any "laggy-ness". 

So far, so good! As I continue using the Macbook, I'm going to take some time to figure out what applications or tools I can install to improve my workflow. But for now, I am quite happy
