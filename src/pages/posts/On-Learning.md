# On Learning

Something you are told a lot as you learn to code is that it will require lifelong learning. That is not something I fully understood at the time, but it becomes more and more clear as I move further along in my career. Technology constantly evolves, of course, and what you may do at work shifts from quarter to quarter. But technology is not the only change, so do you.

As we go about live, we learn more about ourselves. We are challenged in ways that force us to dig deep and reflect in ways we had not previously pondered. It's scary, but it's also enlightening. 

And so, with this realization, also came the necessity to discover *how* to learn. And out of that necessity, I found a few tips. 

*Constantly keep an eye out for information sources.*

Humans learn in a number of different ways and everyone has their preference. What I have noticed is that sometimes people attempt to learn via one method in one situation, it fails, and then they give up. That's one of the reasons it is important to keep your mind open to new information sources, whether that be a YouTube channel, a book, a blog, or a collegue. Of course, it also helps to prevent you from just blindly accepting one single source. 

*Write*

This one took me a while to understand. I have always heard the advice to just write, but I did not see the value in it. However, I have now come to realize it has many values:
1. When writing down what you have learned, it helps solidify the concept or point in your mind, which can allow it to stick
2. Writing information down allows for it to leave your head
3. Consistently writing helps to improve communication skills

One follow-up to this may be *"is typing a suitable replacement to writing?"* I have read a few different opinions on this, but for me personally, I believe typing is a suitable replacement when **what you are typing is not emotional.** This blog post, for example, was typed and never written. But if I am frustrated at the end of the day and want to get that frustration out, typing never really does the trick for me. Of course, your results may vary. 


*The best way to learn is to teach*

I have found that the best way for you to truly learn the topic is by teaching it. Something about trying to example the topic to someone else forces you to examine the topic at a deeper level and gives you the opportunity to dig in further to more deeply examine it. This teaching does not even need to be verbal: I found that just writing it out in a blog post or as documentation provides the same benefit. 


*Do not put yourself in a position to get overwhelmed*

If you have not coded a day in your life and you have decided "I'm going to build out my own Amazon site myself!", you are going to quit. I guarantee it. The task is just so herculian that you have no chance of actually doing it as your first project. When you are planning what you want (or need) to learn, think about creating small and reasonable objectives to aid in your learning. **Plan out your learning.** Find the resources you will use, define your goal(s), define sub-objectives to help you meet that goal, plan out some time in which you are going to work on this. Do whatever you can to put yourself in a position to succeed. 

It has dawned on me that learning to learn is a strange concept, but it is one that matters. Honestly, I think it is one of the most important things we as humans can do. It's part of what makes us human, our capacity to reason and learn. It's also something that makes each day worth exploring, so we can find something else to learn.
