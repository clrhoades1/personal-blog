# On Reaction
Every Sunday morning, I like to go down to my local wildlife rehabiliation center and volunteer for a few hours. Typically I start the morning by cleaning the cages and habitats for some of our ambassador animals, today was no exception. Except, we had gotten a new adult opposum who is going to be ambassador, so they needed their habitat cleaned too. 

Now, I am very used to dealing with opposums. Generally there are two "types" of opposums: 1. Baby and dwarf opposums. These types of opposums are generally not afraid of humans and will generally pay you no mind or are curious. 2. Adult opposums. They are generally very afraid of humans, will curl up in a ball as far away from you as possible and hiss. Naturally, I am prepared for the second kind of opposum. 

As I open up their cage and prepare for them to hide, they instead take a step towards me. **I freeze**. "Why are they walking towards me?" "Am I about to be bit?" "Do I need to leave?" My mind blows through thousands of questions, I am immediately stressed, but I stay. I leave my hand in the cage. The opposum approaches my hand. They sniff. They lick. And then...they nudge my hand, in search for a pet. 

It then dawns on me: this opposum is imprinted on people. That's why they are an ambassador. 

I then chuckle, I confirm the sitation with the staff, and then I go about changing their bedding without incident. In hindsight, I find it really funny that I was internally in a "fight or flight" mode while this little guy was just looking for some attention. 

So why am I mentioning it here? Well, I thought it was a funny incident, but it also made me think quite a bit about other stressful situations. In the past, I was very easily stressed and that stress would completely overwhelp me. I remember a few months after I started my entry level position, I was pulled into a Disaster Recovery Exercise. Our servers had been brought up but our applications were not running. I was in panic mode because I had absolutely no idea what to do. My team lead got pulled into the work session I was in and we were asked "Is MQ running?" I had no idea and I did not know how to check. 

I imagine most of your reading are probably thinking "just Google it" and you are right. But in that moment, I was in such a state of panic that Googling it had not crossed my mind at all. And I don't think it would have had I been given more time. Currently, I consider this to be my lowest moment professionally. Which, I recognize is a privileged thing to admit, but to say I was devestated and disappointed in myself would be an extreme understatement. Today? I am happy to say that I can handle these situations much better and not just panic in oblivion. 

These stressful moment are ultimately defined by two things:
1. What happened
2. How you respond to it

You have no impact on what happened, but you can fully control how you respond to it. With that in mind, I tend to use the following framework to navigate how I respond to these situations:
1. Stop - No good will come from immediately acting without thought. 
2. Breath - Take a moment to bring yourself back down to Earth. Recognize that the world is not going to end. 
3. Assess - Look at the situation/error/etc. Do you understand it? Once you have a clear idea on what is happening. can you resolve it?
4. Confirm - If possible, speak to someone who is knowledgable to confirm your thoughts and the course of action
5. Act

But if nothing else, it is almost always worth taking a moment to take a breath before acting. Ground yourself before you take any drastic action. Unless you're about to be bitten by an opposum..maybe just run instead.
