# Books I Love
I have a bit of a strange relationship with reading. People who like to read tend to read a LOT, but I find myself only picking up a book that genuinely peeks my curiosity. Sci-fi and fantasy? Nope. Self help regarding a random topic that has invaded my mind this week? Ding ding ding. 

It is because of this relationship with choosing books that my list is more on the "self-help guru" side. But regardless of the side of the spectrum this list is on, they are still books I thoroughly enjoyed. 

## Soft Skills by John Sonmez

Outside of college textbooks, this was the first book I bought related to software development and coding. At the time, I was getting close to graduation and was having more and more questions as I was looking at job opportunities. This book was a gamble for a college student without much disposable income, but I am very happy I picked it up. 

John sets out to provide "the software developer's life manual," and while I would not go that far with it, it is a great manual with a lot of great ideas. It goes through the different types of employment you may find yourself in, the concept and tricks to "marketing yourself", productivity and "how to learn" topics, and some thoughts on how to maintain your non-professional life. 

While I do not personally subscribe to every idea in the book, I thoroughly believe that anyone who is seeking to make a career out of coding should read this book.
