In my professional career, I find myself working with many scripting and high level programming languages. There is a lot of convenience in those languages, but I have come to find a cost with those languages and jumping between them: **I lose some understanding of what the code is actually doing.** For example: Powershell. In my experience, it will go out of its way to be as accommodating to the developer as possible. As a result, it will retain a lot of information so that it's available to the developer. Which sounds great, but that is at the cost of some serious overhead. In one example: I had to write a Powershell script that would convert logs in one proprietary format to a standard CSV. Writing the script was simple enough using basic Powershell functions, but I found that the program took an unreasonable amount of time: about an hour for the amount of logs we had. I rewrote the logic that was reading and writing the actual files to use lower level C# calls and the run time went down to 2 minutes. 

Now is this the biggest deal in the world? No. But it just made me think that I have moved further than I would like from days of C++ programming in college and I felt that it would be in my best interest to force myself back into a lower level language to force me to be more deliberate about the code I write.

Which is how I ended up here, attempting to learn and write some programs in Rust.

## Why Rust?
I gave some consideration to which language I wanted to attempt this in, but I ultimately landed on Rust. To be honest, there isn't a particularly elaborate reason for this. I am doing this in my free time and I have some opportunities that opened up at my job to get more time with C++ code for similiar practice. But in my off-time, I wanted to explore something new. And Rust is certainly new to me and is a "hot" language at the moment

## What Will I do in Rust? 
I am still giving some thought on what I would like to write in Rust as an "end-goal" or as some big project. I have already written a little CLI-based todo application, but I think I want to tackle something much bigger. I'm thinking an emulator of some sort, given that it intersects with some outside interests. I was also thinking, now that [Pebble](https://repebble.com) is coming back, about what it would take to write my own firmware for it, could it potentially be done in Rust? 

## Where To Start
Rust has a fair amount of documentation already, including their book, but I decided to start out with some of [Codecademy's articles](https://www.codecademy.com/) to get more familiar. I already mentioned the to-do application in the mist of going through those articles, and I think I will start writing up more articles on Rust itself to help solidify what I am learning. I also need to consider another small project or two to increase my familiarity with the language.

## Time to Code!
