I am just going to say, right off the bad, I am *bad* at UI and frontend design. I do not have a good sense of aesthetic. So even though I have had a web applications class and I have gone through several tutorials for web development, I have steered away from developing websites. The face of the project, the only real thing any user will see, is bound to look bad if I am developing it. 

At least, that was my original thought. Don't get me wrong, I know this website doesn't look amazing, but compared to how it started? Given that I did all of the work myself? I am beyond happy with how it turned out.

As part of doing this work, I ended up discovering a few tips that significantly added in the creation of this website:
1. Space is your friend - and foe
2. Little pockets of interactivity make any webpage **feel** modern
3. Change up the fonts
4. Use a color palette
5. Search for (reasonable) inspiration

### Space is Your Friend - and Foe
When I started the creation of this website, it was just raw HTML. With that comes the default spacing, which instantly makes the website feel like it's from 2002. And truthfully, I kept that raw spacing for quite a while in development. 

### Little Pockets of Interactivity Make Any Webpage Feel Modern
Something you will notice with old website is how little you influence the page. Yes you can click a button or hyperlink, but the amount of *non-action generating* interactivity is small. Ultimately, the pages do not need that type of interactivity anyway, they survived just fine without it. But just because it does not kick off some action does not mean it is meaningless. It is still *engaging the user*, and user engagement is paramount. 

So if you feel like your page is missing something, consider some non-action generating interactivity. Some examples: the area around a hyperlink fading into a darker color when the user hovers over it. An animal/human icon whose eyes follow the cursor around the page. 

### Change up The Fonts
There isn't too much to say on this. Don't just use the defaults :) Check out some font families if you need some inspiration. 

### Use a Color Palette
One issue I kept hitting against was that I do not have a good sense of what colors go together. Fortunately, there are plenty of websites that do this work for you! One example being https://colorhunt.co/, though there are plenty of options to look through. Just make sure you find one that gives you the hex codes for the colors. Once I find the website you want, just sift through the palettes and see which one appeals to you and BAM, you have your colors. 

### Search for (Reasonable) Inspiration
There are millions of webpages already out there, so use them! I went around looking for software developer blogs for inspiration, that's how I realized the importances of interactive web pages. It also helped me feel comfortable about my idea of keeping the site fairly minimal but still appealing.
